#### Port to hugo
Began: 2019-05-05\
Finished: ...\
Remaining work:
- [x] set up initial hugo layout
- [x] migrate first post
- [ ] decide whether to this as an opportunity to remove older, less-relevant, content or whether to leave it around as a reminder of where I've been
- [ ] migrate existing content
- [ ] write build script to build content and push to separate branch (flip setting in gh to point to that branch)
- [ ] backport tracking
- [ ] author a new post

Nice to haves:
- [ ] set up ci to automatically build
