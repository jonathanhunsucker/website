#### Port to hugo
Began: 2019-05-05\
Finished: ...\
Remaining work:
- [x] set up initial hugo layout
- [x] migrate first post
- [x] decide whether to this as an opportunity to remove older, less-relevant, content or whether to leave it around as a reminder of where I've been, _update: it is_
- [x] migrate existing content
- [x] fix dead links and images
- [x] write script to build content and push to separate branch
- [x] go live on new branch, hugo-built (flip setting in gh to point to that branch)
- [x] customize 404 page
- [x] backport tracking

Nice to haves:
- [ ] set up ci to automatically build
- [ ] author a new post
