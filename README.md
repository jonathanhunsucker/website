# Style
#### Avoid mixing modes
Good:

> `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

Bad:

> `a^2 + b^2` = `c^2`

#### Avoid smart punctuation
`./script/check/quotes` and `./script/format/md` are available to check and fix these issues.

#### Greyscale, no exif images
`./script/check/exif` and `./script/format/jpeg` are available to find exif-containing files, and fix both issues.
