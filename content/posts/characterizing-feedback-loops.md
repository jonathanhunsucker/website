title: Characterizing Feedback Loops
publishDate: 2019-05-08

"Positive" and "negative" terminology is ambiguous and causes misunderstanding. When deployed, their employer intends the modifier in one of two ways: either they're referring to the loop's:

- _valence_, eg. is the outcome generally good or bad?
- _growth behavior_, eg. as you go around the loop, is its effect ever-growing or diminishing?

For example, when a bank run is called a positive feedback loop, the speaker is alluding that its growth behavior is self-reinformcing. That is, people withdrawing tends to cause more people to withdraw. Hearing this, an advocate of valence-based terminology would refute, "No, bank runs are bad, so it's a negative feedback loop!". Both people, each in their own sense, are right — though both are sorely confused and possibly yelling at one another.

It's an uphill battle to convince someone else to change their terminology. Instead, consider deploying these alternative terms which side-step the ambiguous ones:

| To connote ↓ \ Instead of → | Positive | Negative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loop's outcome | Virtuous | Vicious |
| Look's growth behavior | Self-reinforcing | Self-dampening |

Taking the bank run example, one could say "Bank runs are a vicious self-reinforcing loop". Folks might scratch their heads at the new terms, but they should share more of your intended meaning.

To better understand this characterization, consider examples of all four types:

| | Virtuous | Vicious |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-reinforcing | Good strong habits | Fighting fire with fire |
| Self-dampening | Elevator safety brakes, governors | asdf |

#### Finer details on characteristics
Sometimes folks disagree about what's good or bad.

From the child's perspective, snowplows on streets is a vicious loop, but from the plow driver's perspective, it's virtuous.  Although contrived that these two people would discuss the snowplows on streets loop, it's clear that they disagree about the loop's outcome and that further discussion might be necessary if they wanted to better understand that disagreement.

At least, with clearer terms, the more informative discussion will be surfaced sooner.
