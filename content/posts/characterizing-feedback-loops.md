title: Characterizing Feedback Loops
publishDate: 2019-05-08

"Positive" and "negative" terminology is ambiguous and causes misunderstanding. People use these terms to convey meaning both about the loop's:

- _valence_, eg. is the outcome generally good or bad?
- _growth behavior_, eg. as you go around the loop, is its effect ever-growing or diminishing?

### Problem

Consider the conversation:

> Alice: "A bank run is a positive feedback."

> Bob: "No, bank runs are bad, so it's a negative feedback loop!"

Alice is highlighting that a bank run tends to exacerbate itself, aka its _growth behavior_, but Bob is talking about the loop's _valence_, or how he feels about the loop's outcome. Both people, each in their own sense, are right — though both are sorely confused and possibly yelling at one another.

### Alternative terminology
It's an uphill battle to convince someone else to change their terminology. Instead, deploy these alternative terms which side-step the ambiguous ones:

| To connote ↓ \ Instead of → | Positive | Negative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loop's outcome | Virtuous | Vicious |
| Look's growth behavior | Self-reinforcing | Self-dampening |

Taking the bank run example, one could say "Bank runs are a vicious self-reinforcing loop". Folks might scratch their heads at the new terms, but they should share more of your intended meaning.

### Examples

| | Virtuous | Vicious |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-reinforcing | Good strong habits | Fighting fire with fire |
| Self-dampening | Elevator safety brakes, governors | No example known so far |

### Finer details on characteristics
Sometimes folks disagree about what's good or bad.

From the child's perspective, snowplows on streets is a vicious loop, but from the plow driver's perspective, it's virtuous.  Although contrived that these two people would discuss the snowplows on streets loop, it's clear that they disagree about the loop's outcome and that further discussion might be necessary if they wanted to better understand that disagreement.

At least, with clearer terms, the more informative discussion will be surfaced sooner.
