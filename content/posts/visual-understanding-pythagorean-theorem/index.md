The Pythagorean Theorem can be derived visually, from the following diagram, constructed by drawing:

1. A right triangle with bases `a` and `b`, forming hypothenuse `c`, begins the diagram
1. Three squares: one from each of the triangle's sides
1. One last square, with side length `a+b`, surrounding the `c`-length square

With this in place, we can see that the are of the last square is `(a+b^2)`, which consists of the `c`-length square, and four right triangles with sides `a` and `b`. 

So, `(a+b)^2` must equal `4(1/2*ab) + c^2`, which shakes out to `a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2`, and finally `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
