The Pythagorean theorem can be derived visually, from the following diagram, constructed by drawing:

1. A right triangle with bases `a` and `b`, forming hypotenuse `c`
1. Three squares: one from each of the triangle's sides
1. One last square, with side length `a+b`, surrounding the `c`-length square

With this in place, we can see that the area of the last square is `(a+b)^2`, which consists of the `c`-length square, and four right triangles with sides `a` and `b`. Altogether:

> `(a+b)^2 = 4(1/2*ab) + c^2`  
> `a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2`  
> `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`
