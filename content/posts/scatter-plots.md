Choosing one option is difficult when options widely vary on many different axes. Scatter plots can help in approaching a decision, as a quick tool for comparing options. 

### Why is it useful?

* Choosing qualities is easier than choosing an option
* Engages visual understanding, eg. clusters indicate options' similarity
* Expresses what you'd otherwise describe verbosely

### Steps

1. Start with a handful of options, these will be the points
1. List at least two qualities you can measure these options against
1. Pick one quality to be the horizontal axis
1. Order the options relative to one another
1. Pick another quality for the vertical axis, and rank the options relatively again

### Examples

* Transportation modes, cost and time
* What to build next, effort and value
