[Flip](https://github.com/jonathanhunsucker/flip-game/) is a puzzle game created by a friend of mine, and brought to life during a hackathon. The goal is to fill the board, which is a grid of cells. Each cell is filled, highlighted, or unfilled. Game play starts with one cell filled. Take a turn, by highlighting filled cells and flipping them over their side â€” filling more cells. Fill the board in few enough turns, to complete that level. Its written in Angular v1.2, and its entry point is the router, declared in [js/app.js](https://github.com/jonathanhunsucker/flip-game/blob/master/js/app.js).
