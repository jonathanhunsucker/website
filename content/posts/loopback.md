I just made [Loopback](http://codef.in/loopback/), a website that plays your microphone audio back to you. 

Where I live, it's frowned upon to open your window, because A/C costs and the like. However, I really enjoy hearing the noise of outside, so I set up a microphone outside my window, wired it under the window sill, and have Loopback running on my desktop. 450% volume is a good level, and it accompanies ambient music well. 

When testing on my laptop, the clips, clacks, taps, and swishes of my hands moving across the keyboard and trackpad reminded me of the noise of a mechanical keyboard (minus the annoying everyone around me bit).

Hopefully the noise will give me focus to study for tomorrow's machine learning midterm.
