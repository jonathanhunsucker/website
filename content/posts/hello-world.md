Here are some things I work on.

### [Boomclap](http://codef.in/boomclap/)
In-browser microphone sampler and beat pad for playback. Make silly repeating beats out of whatever noises you can make.

### [North](http://codef.in/north/)
Pocket compass web page. Uses experimental DeviceOrientationEvents API, and offline application caching.

### [Watson](https://github.com/watson-app/watson)
Listens to your Dropbox account to curate photos (filtering out blurry and duplicates), and provide searching by location and time.

### [Risky Game](https://github.com/jonathantrevorh/risky-game)
Knock-off of the classic board game, Risk, for CS2340. One-off Java Servlet Page back-end exposing in-memory (HashMap) "database", with front-end written in Angular 1.0. 

### [Anything else on my GitHub](https://github.com/jonathantrevorh/)
It is where I publish anything public.
