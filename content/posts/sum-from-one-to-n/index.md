The sum from one to `n` can be clarified visually. Below is a rectangle that's `n+1` cells wide and `n` cells tall. Half the cells are shaded in, representing the quantity`n*(n+1)/2`. As `n` grows by one, another row and colum is introduced, with the entire new column being shaded (accounting for the increment).
