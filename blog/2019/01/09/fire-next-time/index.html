  <h1>The Fire Next Time</h1>
  <div class="entry"><p>James Baldwin’s 1962 book is damn good. Two portions stood out to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced. As for one’s wits, it is just not true that one can live by them — not, that is, if one really wishes to live.<br />
Page 27</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of his argument is that the American dream is fragile and false because it goes unexamined. If it were examined, we’d realize that not everyone is free and equal, and the dream would collapse, taking any assumptions and ego built atop, along with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>White Americans find it as difficult as white people elsewhere do to divest themselves of the notion that they are in possession of some intrinsic value that black people need, or want.<br />
Page 94</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My primary take-away from Baldwin’s book is that equality is not achieved through the mindset that a privileged group is “lifting up” or “granting access” to the a privileged grup. Equality is, instead, achieved by recognizing and embracing that boths groups are the same, thereby realizing there’s no basis for the disparate privilege.</p>
