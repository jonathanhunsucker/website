    <h1>Issue tracking for a team of 1</h1>

<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>

<p>I make <a href="https://lateplateapp.com">Lateplate App</a>, a tiny SaaS, as <a href="/Atomic-Deploys-for-PHP/">mentioned before</a>. People don&rsquo;t often ask for features, but luckily, enough things come to mind to cause contention for what is implemented next.</p>

<h3 id="my-process">My process</h3>

<p>No matter how small the team, some process for tracking what to do next will exist. Either it&rsquo;s stream of thought and you&rsquo;re able to write software quicker than you can forget, or you&rsquo;ve got so many incoming requests that some issues have been seen only by the requester. I&rsquo;m terrible at remembering things, so my issue tracking is only a checklist. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>☐ Make a logo
☐ Suggest adding a diet if the request notes include &quot;vegetarian&quot; or &quot;no meat&quot;, etc
☐ Update to OAuth
☐ Better error page
☐ ----------------------
☐ Create an event storage system to string together user stories
☐ On help page, use referrer to guess a relevant article
☐ Migrate to www.
☐ ----------------------
☑ Get rid of /about page
☑ Precompile views
☑ Add meals to admin panel
☑ Menu uploads via /manage/
</code></pre>

<p>Sections are divided by dashes.</p>

<h4 id="the-first-section-bugs-and-on-mind-features">The first section: Bugs and on-mind features</h4>

<p>Bugs jump straight to the top here. I don&rsquo;t work on features until known bugs are gone. This section contains things that are on my mind and are to be implemented next. When an item is finished, it&rsquo;s commited to master and checked off (moving it to the bottom section). I deploy whenever I feel like, but at least when the top section is exhausted. More often, I&rsquo;ll finish things and check them off, and add things back before this section is emptied.</p>

<h4 id="the-second-section-everything-else">The second section: Everything else</h4>

<p>These are &ldquo;I wish I had [blank]&ldquo;s, and &ldquo;In the future, it&rsquo;d be good to have [blank]&ldquo;s. Things that came to mind once, but aren&rsquo;t worth their development cost right now. A few months ago, the OAuth item was in this section, but it&rsquo;s got an artificial deadline around April, so it&rsquo;s been bumped up.</p>

<h4 id="checked-section">Checked section</h4>

<p>I have never read through this section. It&rsquo;s mostly to make me feel better, and maybe it&rsquo;ll be useful in the future to know what I&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-viable-process">Minimum viable process</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked why I don&rsquo;t use something more formal, like the &ldquo;agile&rdquo; tools mentioned in coursework. They&rsquo;re just not necessary for how few things there are to track. Using something with more features requires manipulating tasks in a framework other than my head. The goal for any interface should be matching the person&rsquo;s mental model as closely as possible. This is echoed in principles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> and books like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think</a>. Tasks are done or not done, in mind or not. Anything more descriptive (points, delivered vs rejected vs unstarted, etc) just gets in the way, for a project this small.</p>
