    <h1>How to Solve It: Progress and achievement</h1>

<p><em>How to Solve It</em> by G. Polya was published in 1945, providing a breakdown of the problem solving process and  handy tools for each subprocess. It&rsquo;s divided into four sections, one of which is a &ldquo;short dictionary of heuristic&rdquo; for solving problems. One of these heuristic definitions stood out to me, &ldquo;Progress and achievement&rdquo; page 157, because it put in words the tactics I find myself using without having enumerated them before. I share them here, as a reminder for myself, and reference to pass along for others.</p>

<hr />

<p>The feeling of making progress towards a solution drives me to continue. Though, working hard and seeing no tangible ground covered erodes my will to keep at it. Therefore problem solving skills shouldn&rsquo;t be left to haphazard intuition alone, but instead, studied in order to gain a well-honed tool.</p>

<hr />

<p>The problem solving process is broken into stages, with no distinct delineation. Nevertheless, each subprocess is worth naming, so as to better understand the whole.</p>

<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<p>Bringing up from memory relevant information (eg. related problems, or similar unknowns) is called <em>mobilization</em>.</p>

<p>Second stage is the combination of isolated facts, constructing a cohesive concept from mobilized knowledge. This is deemed <em>organization</em>.</p>

<p>These are two aspects of the same thing: progress of work.</p>

<p>Another aspect of progress is changes in our <em>mode of conception</em>. Varying the problem, facts, mobilized knowledge, trying out various viewpoints, or organized concepts, is progress in itself.</p>

<p>Yet another aspect is <em>precepting</em> the next steps which bring you closer to a solution. The more accurate the precepts, the more progress has been made, the closer in the spiral towards an answer you are.</p>

<hr />

<p>Polya provides questions to further each stage.</p>

<h3 id="aiding-questions">Aiding Questions</h3>

<p>Questions which aid mobilization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have you seen it before? Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?</li>
<li>Do you know a related problem?</li>
<li>Do you know a theorem that could be useful?</li>
<li>Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same/similar problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions which aid organization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Here is a related problem to yours and solved before. Could you use it? Could you use its method? Could you use its result?</li>
<li>Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>To gather more material:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you use all the data?</li>
<li>Did you use the whole condition?</li>
<li>Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>To vary the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Could you restate the problem?</li>
<li>Could you state it still differently?</li>
<li>Could you redefine the principle terms?</li>
<li>Is there an analogy to be drawn?</li>
<li>Can you generalize the problem?</li>
<li>Can you specialize the problem?</li>
<li>How can you decompose and recombine it?</li>
</ul>

<p>To suggest preceptions about the solution&rsquo;s nature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to satisfy the condition?</li>
<li>Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? Or it is insufficient? Redundant? Contradictory?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>When framing a problem, think hard about how a person might answer these questions. Does your problem statement usher them towards a solution? If not, go back and restate the problem.</p>
