<h3 id="aim">Aim</h3>

<p>Find a short and simple formulation of the quadratic formula. I made multiple attempts at formulation throughout a day, and catalogued the changes made between them.</p>

<h3 id="learnings">Learnings</h3>

<p>Coming up with tidy formulations is a progression. There are multiple paths, all with the same outcome (the quadratic formula), but with different amounts of clarity, self-explanation, and ease of following along. Later formulations were shorter or involved less algebraic shuffling to settle out, but traded away clarity to achieve it. For example, Formulation #8 has a &ldquo;scale by <code>4a</code>&rdquo; step. This creates for less shuffling later on, at the cost of pulling <code>4a</code> from thin air.</p>

<h3 id="eleven-formulations">Eleven formulations</h3>

<p><img src="images/page-1.jpg" alt="Formulations #1 and #2" />
The first approach failed, having not realized that <code>c</code> needs to be isolated in order to simplify getting into the <code>j^2+2jk+k^2</code> form. After approaching the problem in reverse, in formulation #2, I realize that multiplying by <code>4a</code> will help.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-2.jpg" alt="Formulation #3" />
Recognize that &ldquo;Completing the square&rdquo; will be useful here, and take <code>ax^2</code> as <code>j^2</code>, leading to radicals in <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>, making the middle section heavy, and dedicating the last section towards simplifying the formula.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-3.jpg" alt="Formuluation #4" />
Leave <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> in for longer, hoping that the formula will simplify a little before needing to resubstitute them. Doesn&rsquo;t achieve much towards that goal.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-4.jpg" alt="Formulations #5 and #6" />
Formulation #5 jumps straight into finding substitute values for <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>. It does achieve a shorter formulation, but at the expensive of a jarring substitution.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-5.jpg" alt="Formulations #7 and #8" />
Formulation #7 is the last one with radicals in <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>. Formulation #8 introduces a &ldquo;scale by <code>4a</code>&rdquo; step early on, letting <code>j=2ax</code> and <code>k=b</code> — something easier to work with in the middle and late sections, but another &ldquo;magic&rdquo; step from left field.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-6.jpg" alt="Formulations #9 through #11" />
Formulation #9 adds per-step descriptions. Formulation #10 is the shortest so far. Formulation #11 issued an attempt to integrate the visual representation of completing the square, but was abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="outstanding-questions">Outstanding questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is there a formulation where &ldquo;completing the square&rdquo; springs up naturally, as opposed to being brought in through epiphany or prior knowledge?</li>
<li>How might people rank these formulations, in terms of their clarity?</li>
<li>If &ldquo;completing the square&rdquo; and &ldquo;equation manipulation tactics&rdquo; are prerequisites for &ldquo;find the quadratic formula&rdquo;, what problems have &ldquo;find the quadratic formula&rdquo; as a prerequisite?</li>
</ul>
